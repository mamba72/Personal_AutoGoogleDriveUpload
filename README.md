# Personal_AutoGoogleDriveUpload
This is a personal project I've been working on. The idea mainly came from my mom's struggle with keeping her pictures backed up and/or in one location, so this is a program that periodically scans given folders and ensures there's a copy of them on a Google Drive account.
